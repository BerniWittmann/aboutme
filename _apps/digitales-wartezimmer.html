title: Digitales Wartezimmer
subtitle: Simple and efficient exchange of information between health authorities and citizens for rapid containment of infectious diseases
description:  With our digital solution, all relevant information of COVID-19 contact persons will be digitally captured and transferred to the systems used by the responsible health authorities to track contact persons. By digitizing the transmission of COVID-19 contact person data, we want to help health authorities break the chain of infection quickly. At the same time, the COVID-19 contact person solution should provide a fast and user-friendly way to contact his/her health authority. In further steps, this information transfer will be extended by further digital solutions, so that a reciprocal digital communication between health authorities and citizens is enabled.
