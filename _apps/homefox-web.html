subtitle: HomeFox Web-Application
description: As a working student I worked mainly on the frontend of the HomeFox webapp. My main challenges here were the redesign, migration of the navigation and later a complete rebuild from scratch. The system is running the Tornado framework (Python) in the backend and Vue.js in the frontend.
